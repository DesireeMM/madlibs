        I went to {{place}} with <span>{% for celeb in celebrities %}
            {% if celeb != celebrities[-1] %}
           {{celeb}} and {% else %} {{celeb}}{% endif %}{% endfor %}</span>. 
        <br><br>I couldn't believe when {{celebrities[0]}} showed up in {{color}}!
        <br><br>That was {{adj}}. I had to cope by buying a {{noun}}.
